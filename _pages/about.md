I am Postdoctoral Researcher at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), where I work on computer vision and machine learning systems with a focus on data-efficient learning algorithms to make vision technologies more accessible, affordable and human-centric.

I am broadly interested in research collaborations on innovative learning paradigms like semi-weakly supervised and self-supervised learning, visual in‑context learning and data-centric AI, feel free to reach out!
At KIT I am also frequently supervising thesis projects and am always looking for bright, motivated students to work with.


**Selected Publications**
I co-authored publications at top venues such as CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, NeurIPS, AAAI and MICCAI, where I contributed to research fields such as semi-weakly supervised learning, visual in-context learning and to applications in domains where data-scarcity is prevalent, such as semantic segmentation in medical imaging.
