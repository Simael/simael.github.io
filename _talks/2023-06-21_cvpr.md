|![Photo poster presentation](/images/presentation/cvpr_presentation_2023.png)| In Vancouver at CVPR 2023 I presented two papers, first, the paper [Delivering arbitrary-modal semantic segmentation](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Zhang_Delivering_Arbitrary-Modal_Semantic_Segmentation_CVPR_2023_paper.html) on multi-modal street-scene segmentation by lead authors Jiaming Zhang and Ruiping Liu, and later I presented the paper [Decoupled semantic prototypes enable learning from diverse annotation types for semi-weakly segmentation in expert-driven domains](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Reiss_Decoupled_Semantic_Prototypes_Enable_Learning_From_Diverse_Annotation_Types_for_CVPR_2023_paper.html) which explores techniques for training segmentation models with diverse annotation-types to ease the annotation process. I was also fortunate to attend the CVPR Doctoral Consortium, a wonderful event where I could present my work to Prof. Ren√© Vidal and discuss computer vision in clinical settings with him. |
