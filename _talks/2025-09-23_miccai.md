|![Title page of presentation](/images/presentation/miccaipresentation2025.png)| At MICCAI Workshops 2025, together with my former student Alessio Negrini I presented our paper [Conquering the Retina: Bringing Visual in-Context Learning to OCT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15200) in the poster session of the [Efficient Medical AI 2025 Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/ema4miccai2025/home) and later I presented our poster on [Semantic Segmentation for Preoperative Planning in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16573) in the context of the [STACOM workshop](https://stacom.github.io/). I further had the pleasure to present the paper [GRASPing Anatomy to Improve Pathology Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03374) for my colleague Alexander Jaus and his student Keyi Li in the the [MLMI workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/mlmi2025/)'s poster session. ||
