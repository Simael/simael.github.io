|![Title page of presentation](/images/presentation/iccvpresentation2025.png)| In Honolulu, at the ICCV 2025, apart from attending exceptional workshops on a diverse set of topics such as world models, data-efficient learning and foundation models, I presented our paper [Is Visual in-Context Learning for Compositional Medical Tasks within Reach?](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2025/html/Reiss_Is_Visual_in-Context_Learning_for_Compositional_Medical_Tasks_within_Reach_ICCV_2025_paper.html) in one of the poster sessions. Engaging with many researchers at the conference has been a joy and I gathered a lot of inspiration through the phenomenal work happening in the community. ||
