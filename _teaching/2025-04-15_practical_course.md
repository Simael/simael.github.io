This practical course explores the development of real-time, interactive computer vision systems for humanâ€“machine interaction. Students work individually or in small teams on subprojects within a common theme, with the option to propose their own ideas. The focus is on applying fundamental computer vision and machine learning methods to real-world scenarios, solving practical challenges, and testing systems in realistic environments. Through hands-on development, teamwork, and final presentations, participants gain technical skills, problem-solving experience, and the ability to communicate their work effectively ([Website](https://cvhci.iar.kit.edu/600.php)).
