*Frequent supervisor in master's and bachelor's thesis projects*

I supervise computer vision and deep learning thesis projects with a focus on different learning paradigms. Key topics include semi-supervised and data-efficient segmentation of medical images, domain adaptation, and image-to-image translation. I also support research on large language models and visual in-context learning, with an emphasis on model efficiency and interactivity. Students gain hands-on experience developing advanced AI methods for real-world applications and improving model generalization with limited data. I frequently publish papers with my students at international conferences.

In case you are interested in working on your thesis with me feel free to send me a mail, let's discuss interesting topics!
