This seminar focuses on current research fields in computer vision. Topics covered include self-supervised learning, weakly supervised learning and many more subfields in computer vision. Participants independently research current computer vision methods, present their findings and produce a detailed written report. The course emphasizes deep understanding of vision-based approaches, critical evaluation of recent research, and effective scientific communication ([Website](https://cvhci.iar.kit.edu/600.php)).
