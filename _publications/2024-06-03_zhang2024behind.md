excerpt: 'The paper presents Trans4PASS+, a transformer-based model for panoramic semantic segmentation, addressing image distortions and scarce annotations via Deformable Patch Embedding and Deformable MLP modules. It improves Mutual Prototypical Adaptation with pseudo-label rectification and introduces SynPASS, a 9,080-panoramic image dataset for Synthetic-to-Real adaptation. The method achieves state-of-the-art results on four domain-adaptive benchmarks.'

In this paper, we address panoramic semantic segmentation which is under-explored due to two critical challenges: (1) image distortions and object deformations on panoramas; (2) lack of semantic annotations in the 360∘ imagery. To tackle these problems, first, we propose the upgraded Transformer for Panoramic Semantic Segmentation, i.e., Trans4PASS+, equipped with Deformable Patch Embedding (DPE) and Deformable MLP (DMLPv2) modules for handling object deformations and image distortions whenever (before or after adaptation) and wherever (shallow or deep levels). Second, we enhance the Mutual Prototypical Adaptation (MPA) strategy via pseudo-label rectification for unsupervised domain adaptive panoramic segmentation. Third, aside from Pinhole-to-Panoramic (Pin2Pan) adaptation, we create a new dataset (SynPASS) with 9,080 panoramic images, facilitating Synthetic-to-Real (Syn2Real) adaptation scheme in 360° imagery. Extensive experiments are conducted, which cover indoor and outdoor scenarios, and each of them is investigated with Pin2Pan and Syn2Real regimens. Trans4PASS+ achieves state-of-the-art performances on four domain adaptive panoramic semantic segmentation benchmarks.
