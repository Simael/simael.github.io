excerpt: 'This work introduces Sims4Action, a dataset created by capturing Activities of Daily Living (ADL) from the game THE SIMS 4 to address challenges in collecting real-world annotated data. It enables flexible data generation with varied environments and views. The GamingToReal benchmark tests how well models trained on game data transfer to real videos. Results show promise but highlight challenges in mixing simulated and real data, opening new research directions. The dataset will be publicly available.'

Recognizing Activities of Daily Living (ADL) is a vital process for intelligent assistive robots, but collecting large annotated datasets requires time-consuming temporal labeling and raises privacy concerns, e.g., if the data is collected in a real household. In this work, we explore the concept of constructing training examples for ADL recognition by playing life simulation video games and introduce the SIMS4ACTION dataset created with the popular commercial game THE SIMS 4. We build Sims4Action by specifically executing actions-of-interest in a "top-down" manner, while the gaming circumstances allow us to freely switch between environments, camera angles and subject appearances. While ADL recognition on gaming data is interesting from the theoretical perspective, the key challenge arises from transferring it to the real-world applications, such as smart-homes or assistive robotics. To meet this requirement, Sims4Action is accompanied with a GamingToReal benchmark, where the models are evaluated on real videos derived from an existing ADL dataset. We integrate two modern algorithms for video-based activity recognition in our framework, revealing the value of life simulation video games as an inexpensive and far less intrusive source of training data. However, our results also indicate that tasks involving a mixture of gaming and real data are challenging, opening a new research direction. We will make our dataset publicly available at this [https URL](https://github.com/aroitberg/sims4action).
