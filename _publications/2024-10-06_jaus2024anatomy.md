excerpt: 'The paper presents APEx, a segmentation model that integrates anatomical and pathological features to improve pathology segmentation. Using a query-based transformer and a mixing strategy, APEx enables anatomy-informed pathology predictions, achieving state-of-the-art results on FDG-PET-CT and Chest X-ray tasks. Code and models are publicly available.'

Pathological structures in medical images are typically deviations from the expected anatomy of a patient. While clinicians consider this interplay between anatomy and pathology, recent deep learning algorithms specialize in recognizing either one of the two, rarely considering the patient’s body from such a joint perspective.
In this paper, we develop a generalist segmentation model that combines anatomical and pathological information, aiming to enhance the segmentation accuracy of pathological features. Our Anatomy-Pathology Exchange (APEx) training utilizes a query-based segmentation transformer which decodes a joint feature space into query-representations for human anatomy and interleaves them via a mixing strategy into the pathology-decoder for anatomy-informed pathology predictions.
In doing so, we are able to report the best results across the board on FDG-PET-CT and Chest X-Ray pathology segmentation tasks with a margin of up to
as compared to strong baseline methods. Code and models are available at [github.com/alexanderjaus/APEx](github.com/alexanderjaus/APEx).
